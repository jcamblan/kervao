    intro: "The three gîtes are in a single long building constructed between the autumn of 2004 and the summer of 2005. We sought to bring together the best of modern building - light, insulation, etc. - with the proportions of typical local buildings.<br>Although they are terraced, the gîtes are well separated and each has its own patio and small garden of about 50sqm. The car park and the larger garden of 1600 sqm are common to all three gîtes."
